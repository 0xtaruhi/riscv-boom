About The Berkeley Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor
================================================

Source repository for the Berkeley Out-of-Order RISC-V processor (BOOM).

This repository only covers the source code to a "BOOM Tile" - the uncore and
surrounding infrastructure will need to be provided.

BOOM depends on the Chisel project. It also depends on Rocket and uncore source
codes.
