The Berkeley Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor
================================================

This is the source repository for the RV64G RISC-V superscalar Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM), 
written in the [Chisel hardware construction language](http://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu). BOOM 
is a synthesizable core that targets ASIC processes. It can run on an FPGA (50 MHz on a zc706), 
but optimizing it to be an FPGA soft-core is a non-goal.

**Requirements**

This repository is **NOT A SELF-RUNNING** repository. To instantiate a BOOM core, please use the Rocket chip generator found in the rocket-chip git repository (https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip).

BOOM depends on the Chisel project. It also depends on [Rocket](https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket), [uncore](https://github.com/ucb-bar/uncore), and [junction](https://github.com/ucb-bar/junctions) source codes.


**Directions**

To build a BOOM C++ emulator and run BOOM through a couple of simple tests:

````
   $ git clone https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip.git
   $ cd rocket-chip
   $ git checkout boom
   $ git submodule update --init
   $ cd riscv-tools
   $ git submodule update --init --recursive riscv-tests
   $ cd ../emulator; make run CONFIG=BOOMCPPConfig
````

**Disclaimer!**

The RISC-V privileged ISA and platform specs are still in flux. BOOM will do its best to stay up-to-date with it!

BOOM is a work-in-progress and remains in active development.
